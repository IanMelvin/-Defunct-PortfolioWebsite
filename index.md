## Ian Melvin
I'm Ian Melvin, I make games and other miscellaneous programming projects. I have worked in Unity, Android Studios, and Shadertoy amongst other programs. Much of my experience programming is with C++ and C#, but I'm familiar with many other languages such as JavaScript, OpenGL, and Kotlin. My biggest passion with programming is UI programming for video games.

## Projects

### Game Engine (Class Project)

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.engineId %}

Description: A game engine developed in Visual Studios using C++. Currently the engine is set up with functionality to place/delete a sprite, freeze/unfreeze the sprite's animation, and exit the program. This is set up to be a demo and show that the engine works. This is the set up for a team based project to develop a game in my engine. The video highlights main.cpp, the Game Class, and two of the Input classes.
