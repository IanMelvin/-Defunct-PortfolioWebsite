## Ian Melvin
I'm Ian Melvin, I make games and other miscellaneous programming projects. I have worked in Unity, Android Studios, and Shadertoy amongst other programs. Much of my experience programming is with C++ and C#, but I am familiar with many other languages such as JavaScript, OpenGL, and Kotlin. My biggest passion with programming is UI programming for video games.
